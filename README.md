DriverPass offers a more efficient method for student drivers to prepare for their written driving tests, and arrange sessions for their hands-on driving exams. DriverPass aimed to develop a platform where users can sign up, buy study materials, complete their studies and exams online, and set up driving practice sessions with instructors. Workers at DriverPass must also have the capability to buy packages for clients and book their appointments. I found my project 2 diagrams to be clear and helpful in illustrating important concepts of the application. I believe I could have provided more thorough explanation of my assumptions and constraints in the Business Requirements Document for project 1. I would add a couple more restrictions and presumptions. I believed I grasped the user's needs through the technical specifications and interview. I developed use cases and corresponding diagrams to represent the user's requirements visually. Next, I customized the requirements to fit the capabilities of a website. The primary focus should be on meeting the needs of the users, as they are the most frequent site visitors. Considering both functional and non-functional requirements proved to be very beneficial in the process of designing software. I also found that developing use case, UML, and Gantt diagrams was incredibly beneficial for visualizing and clarifying the functionality of the application for others.
